# Density-based-traffic-controller
To control the traffic lights based on the density of the vehicles to reduce traffic congestion. To develop coding and to implement it in hardware of density based traffic light control system using arduino.
System detects vehicle density at traffic junctions and allots the required time to traffic lights for vehicle passage dynamically. Classifier is trained using positive and negative images. Further, Adaptive Boosting is used to combine a number of weak classifiers into a strong one. The outcome of AdaBoost is Trained Cascade, which is finally used to detect vehicles in the images clicked.The system uses webcam and opencv to detect vehicles,  number of vehicles in each lane is being calculated. A decision making algorithm is being designed which will calculate the time for which a lane will be active count them and allow traffic passage according to traffic density of each lanes.
